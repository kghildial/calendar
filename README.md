# Calendar

This is a calendar widget made in HTML, CSS & JavaScript.

I have used SCSS as the CSS preprocessor & a Bootstrap-grid like css file.

## Steps to run:

After downloading or cloning the repository:

### If you have nodeJS installed:

* Open the repository in a terminal and run `npm install`
* Once the packages are installed `npm start`

### Alternative method:

* Just naviagate to the **'src'** folder and open *index.html*
